# This is Jonathan Seel's Exercise Repo

We use **this file** to practice markdown
We have tried:

1. `git clone`: this is you copy/download a Repo
2. `git status`: this shows that status of the current repo
3. `git add .`: this stages all changes
4. `git commit -am "msg"`: this commit the changes to the repo
